/*
 * This example shows how to use a Thermal Receipt Printer with Processing
 * The part used is #597 from Adafruit (labeled "Model BT-2")
 *
 * Only attach the yellow wire to the TX pin of your Single Board Computer
 * and the black wire to a GND pin. Don't connect the green wire to the RX
 * pin, since this is not used any might damage your SBC due to the higher
 * voltage used by the printer.
 *
 * The printer draws a considerable amount of power, so make sure to power
 * it from an external 5V ~ 2A power supply.
